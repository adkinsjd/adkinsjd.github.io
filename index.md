Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I am a fourth year PhD student in 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science working with 
Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu) at the 
University of California, Berkeley.
I am an [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).\\
\\
My research focuses on creating, deploying, programming, and interacting with 
ubiquitous sensor systems. I'm currently most interested in two problems:
1) How can we enable the easy deployment and management of dense sensor
networks, and 2) programming systems that will allow us to easily specify programs
for an entire set of these sensors and actuators while still working within
their energy, power, memory, and computational constraints.\\
\\
I am most actively working on the design, construction, deployment, and management
of [power grid reliability sensors](github.com/lab11/plugwatch) in Accra, Ghana as part of the [GridWatch](grid.watch) project.
These sensors will help us to both independently evaluate the impact of grid 
improvements on reliability, and, in collaboration with a team of UC Berkeley economists, 
to quantify the socioeconomic impacts of (un)reliability. We currently
have a deployment of nearly 400 sensors and many phone applications running in Accra. [A paper about insights from the 
deployment](https://joshuaadkins.com/publications/compass19.pdf) was presented at COMPASS 2019.\\
\\
Other recent projects include the
[Signpost platform for city-scale sensing](github.com/lab11/signpost), 
and a new generation of indoor sensor nodes.
Signpost is a modular, energy-harvesting platform that attempts to 
lower the bar to city-scale sensing by removing
the need for wired power and networking. 
[The paper](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins18signpost.pdf) was presented at IPSN 2018.
[The new indoor sensor nodes](github.com/lab11/permamote) are
energy harvesting, include a primary cell battery to increase reliability, 
and are being designed with the newest technology to achieve longer
lifetimes. I collaborated with Neal Jackson on [a paper about their design](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/jackson19capacity), which he will present at IPSN 2019.\\
\\
In the past I worked on [Monoxalyze](github.com/lab11/monoxalyze), 
which works with a smartphone 
to provide a keychain-sized smoking cessation compliance mechanism; a paper
on the topic appeared at [SenSys 2016](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins16monoxalyze.pdf).<br/>
