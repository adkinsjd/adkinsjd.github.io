Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I am a sixth year PhD student in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the
University of California, Berkeley and the CTO and co-founder of <i>n</i>Line, an infrastructure
reliability monitoring company.\\
\\
At Berkeley, my research focuses on creating, deploying, programming, and interacting with
ubiquitous sensor systems. I'm currently most interested in two problems:
1) How can we enable the easy deployment and management of dense sensor
networks, and 2) programming systems that will allow us to easily specify programs
for an entire set of these sensors and actuators while still working within
their energy, power, memory, and computational constraints. I hope these efforts
help scientists and researchers more easily collect data for and propose solutions
to the world's most pressing problems.\\
\\
At <i>n</i>Line we work to collect data about the reliability of critical infrastructure starting
with the power grid. This data can then be used to evaluate the existing equity and reliability
of infrastructure, assist governments in creating policy to increase infrastructure reliability, help
utilities better operate and maintain infrastructure, or evaluate and
improve investments into infrastructure. I hope that some day it can also support the stories of how 
unreliable infrastructure impacts peoples' lives. The work started as a collaboration with UC Berkeley
economists to evaluate the efficacy of investments made during the Ghana Power Compact and has
now grown to support projects in seven countries. <i>n</i>Line is intentionally not
backed by venture-capital so that we can focus on our mission without external pressure to grow
or increase net profits.\\
\\
I am currently living in Oakland, California. During my spare time I play bass,
hike and bike in the California mountains, and think about the intersection
of technology, socioeconomic systems, and academia.
