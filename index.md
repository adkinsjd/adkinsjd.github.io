Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I am a second year PhD student in 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science working with 
Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu) at the 
University of California, Berkeley.
I am currently on an [NSF GRFP Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).\\
\\
My research focuses on creating, deploying, programming, and interacting with 
ubiquitous sensor systems. I'm currently most interested in two problems:
1) How can we enable the easy deployment and management of dense sensor
networks, and 2) Programming systems that will allow us to easily specify programs
for an entire set of these sensors and actuators while still working within
their power and memory constraints.\\
\\
Two of my active research projects that fit within this problem space are the 
[Signpost platform for city-scale sensing](github.com/lab11/signpost), 
and a new generation of indoor sensor nodes.
Signpost is a modular, energy-harvesting platform that attempts to 
lower the bar to city-scale sensing by removing
the need for wired power and networking. 
[The paper](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins18signpost.pdf) will be presented at IPSN 2018, 
and we are currently 
deploying the system on UC Berkeley's campus! The new indoor sensor nodes are also
energy harvesting, include a primary cell battery to increase reliability, 
and are being designed with the newest technology to achieve longer
lifetimes. They will include services such as localization and self energy
monitoring that will make them easier to densely deploy and program.\\
\\
In the past I have worked on [Monoxalyze](github.com/lab11/monoxalyze), 
which works with a smartphone 
to provide a keychain-sized smoking cessation compliance mechanism; a paper
on the topic appeared at [ACM SenSys 2016](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins16monoxalyze.pdf). I have
also worked on lowering the bar to casually interacting devices by collaborating
on [Summon](http://github.com/lab11/summon), 
a web browser for physical devices, designed a
a miniature, solar powered Bluetooth beacon called [Cinamin](http://github.com/lab11/cinamin-beacon), 
and proposed
[Ving](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins15ving.pdf), 
an idea to discover and communicate with devices sitting on the same surface
using the vibratory motors commonly found in mobile phones.
