Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I'm the CTO and co-founder of <i>n</i>Line, an infrastructure
reliability monitoring company. I recently earned my PhD in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley.\\
\\
At <i>n</i>Line we work to collect data about the reliability of critical infrastructure starting
with the power grid. This data can then be used to evaluate the existing equity and reliability
of infrastructure, assist governments in creating policy to increase infrastructure reliability, help
utilities better operate and maintain infrastructure, or evaluate and
improve investments into infrastructure. I hope that some day it can also support the stories of how
unreliable infrastructure impacts peoples' lives. The work started as a collaboration with Berkeley
economists to evaluate the efficacy of investments made during the Ghana Power Compact and has
now grown to support projects in seven countries. <i>n</i>Line is intentionally not
backed by venture-capital so that we can focus on our mission
without external pressure to grow or increase net profits.\\
\\
My PhD research focused on creating, deploying, programming, and interacting with
ubiquitous sensor systems. Specifically I propose forming sensors into a computing cluster and
programming them similar to how we program modern cloud infrastructure while respecting their
energy, power, memory, and computational constraints. I hope these efforts can
help scientists and researchers more easily collect data for and propose solutions
to the world's most pressing problems.\\
\\
I am currently living in Oakland, California. During my spare time I play bass,
hike and bike in the California mountains, and think about the intersection
of technology, socioeconomic systems, and academia.
