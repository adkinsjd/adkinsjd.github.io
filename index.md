Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I am a fifth year PhD student in 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science working with 
Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu) at the 
University of California, Berkeley.
I am an [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).\\
\\
My research focuses on creating, deploying, programming, and interacting with 
ubiquitous sensor systems. I'm currently most interested in two problems:
1) How can we enable the easy deployment and management of dense sensor
networks, and 2) programming systems that will allow us to easily specify programs
for an entire set of these sensors and actuators while still working within
their energy, power, memory, and computational constraints.\\
\\
I am most actively working on the design, construction, deployment, and management
of [power grid reliability sensors](https://github.com/lab11/plugwatch) in Accra, Ghana as part of [GridWatch](https://grid.watch) and [nLine](https://nline.io).
These sensors will help us to both independently evaluate the impact of grid 
improvements on reliability, and, in collaboration with a team of UC Berkeley economists, 
to quantify the socioeconomic impacts of (un)reliability. We currently
have a deployment of nearly 700 sensors running in Accra. [A paper about insights from the 
deployment](https://joshuaadkins.com/publications/compass19.pdf) was presented at COMPASS 2019.\\
\\
I am also working on a resource manager for the servers, gateways, and resource constrained
sensors that constitute the "edge". By modifying  the communications protocols and
execution environments of a traditional resource manager to operate under the resource
constraints of low-power sensors, we hope to enable multiple users to program
sets of sensors through high-level, and potentially interactive programming environments.
Check out the in-progress [code base for this project](https://github.com/conix-center/edge-rm).\\
\\
In the past I have worked on: 

&#9;&#9;<b>-</b> [A new generation of indoor, harvesting sensor nodes](https://github.com/lab11/permamote)
that uses both primary and secondary cells to increase energy reliability, which Neal Jackson 
[presented at IPSN 2019](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/jackson19capacity).

&#9;&#9;<b>-</b> The [Signpost platform for city-scale sensing](https://github.com/lab11/signpost), a modular, energy-harvesting 
platform for lowering the bar to city-scale sensing [presented at IPSN 2018](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins18signpost.pdf).

&#9;&#9;<b>-</b> [Monoxalyze](https://github.com/lab11/monoxalyze), which works with a smartphone 
to provide a keychain-sized smoking cessation compliance mechanism and was 
[presented at SenSys 2016](https://lab11.eecs.berkeley.edu/content/pubs/adkins16monoxalyze.pdf).<br>
