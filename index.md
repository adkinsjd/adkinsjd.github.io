Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I currently work as a Research Assistant with 
Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu) at the 
University of California Berkeley, where I just started as a first year 
PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
I recently won an [NSF GRFP Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).\\
\\
My research focuses on creating and interacting with small, low-power
embedded systems. I have looked into securing mobile interactions between people
and embedded systems in the [Monoxalyze](http://github.com/lab11/monoxalyze) project, 
which works with a smartphone 
to provide a keychain-sized smoking cessation compliance mechanism; a paper
on the topic appeared at [ACM SenSys 2016](http://sensys.acm.org/2016/). I have
also worked on lowering the bar to casually interacting devices by collaborating
on [Summon](http://github.com/lab11/summon), 
a web browser for physical devices, working to create
a miniature, solar powered Bluetooth beacon called [Cinamin](http://github.com/lab11/cinamin-beacon), 
and proposing
an idea to discover and communicate with devices sitting on the same surface
using the vibratory motors commonly found in mobile phones to transmit vibrations
and accelerometer to receive the vibrations.\\
\\
A lot of my work has involved Bluetooth Low Energy. Monoxalyze, Summon, and 
Cinamin
have all used BLE, and I have also created a 0.5 in<sup>2</sup>, drop-in, 
BLE module called 
[Nucleum](http://github.com/lab11/nucleum) that makes it easy to integrate
BLE into new designs.\\
\\
Currently I am working on a project to build and deploy energy-harvesting, 
city-scale sensors that will be attached to signposts. This allows for 
city-scale sensing and control without the modification or addition of
infrastructure, which is often a hindrance to large sensor deployments.
