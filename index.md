Hi, I'm Josh Adkins. I currently work as a Research Assistant with 
Prabal Dutta and [Lab11](http://lab11.eecs.umich.edu) at the 
University of Michigan. I just graduated with an undergraduate
degree in Computer Engineering, and in the fall I will be starting
a PhD program at UC Berkeley in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I
recently won an [NSF GRFP Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).\\
\\
My research focuses on creating and interacting with small, low-power
embedded systems. I have looked into securing mobile interactions between people
and embedded systems in the [Monoxalyze](http://github.com/lab11/monoxalyze) project, 
which works with a smartphone 
to provide a key-chain size smoking cessation compliance mechanism. I have
also worked on lowering the bar to casually interacting devices by collaborating
on [Summon](http://github.com/lab11/summon), 
a web browser for physical devices, working to create
a miniature, solar powered Bluetooth beacon called [Cinamin](http://github.com/lab11/cinamin-beacon), 
and proposing
an idea to discover and communicate with devices sitting on the same surface
using the vibratory motors commonly found in mobile phones to transmit vibrations
and accelerometer to receive the vibrations.\\
\\
A lot of my work has involved Bluetooth Low Energy. Monoxalyze, Summon, and 
Cinamin
have all used BLE, and I have also created a 0.5 in<sup>2</sup>, drop-in, 
BLE module called 
[Nucleum](http://github.com/lab11/nucleum) that makes it easy to integrate
BLE into new designs.
